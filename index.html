                <dt>PH</dt>
                <dd>The accepted pH level in a basic saltwater system is between 7.6
                    and 8.4, but reef tanks are more sensitive, and therefore need
                    to be kept at the higher end of the pH scale, 8.0 to 8.4</dd>
                <dt>Alk</dt>
                <dd>The ideal alkalinity for a reef tank is 8-12 dkh. That’s a pretty
                    broad range. Perhaps more important than reaching a level within
                    that range is trying to stay consistent once you find an
                    alkalinity level that suits the inhabitants of your tank and is
                    easy to maintain, based on your local water.</dd>
                <dt>Mag</dt>
                <dd>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Libero,
                    commodi, laudantium dicta maiores repudiandae minima rerum
                    ratione vero adipisci hic eius voluptatibus minus veritatis
                    vitae, alias ad ullam mollitia aperiam.</dd>
                <dt>Calcium</dt>
                <dd>The world’s oceans tend to have reef calcium levels between
                    380-420ppm (parts per million). That’s a fairly narrow range
                    (around~400ppm). So, to keep things simple, I generally think of
                    the optimal reef tank calcium level to be about 400ppm.</dd>
                <dt>Ammonia</dt>
                <dd>Ammonia occurs naturally as a byproduct of the organic waste
                    breaking down in your tank. Ammonia gets into your reef tank
                    when your fish pee (yes, normal biological functions apply to
                    fish, too) and when food and other biological components
                    (plants, live rock, etc.) rot. So it’s perfectly natural to see
                    it in your tank. The problem is ammonia is toxic waste in your
                    aquarium. In chemical terms, ammonia is a base or a basic
                    compound – the opposite of an acid.</dd>
                <dt>Phosphate</dt>
                <dd>The seventh most important reef tank water parameter to monitor
                    is phosphate. Phosphate occurs naturally on reefs and is present
                    at a level of ~0.13 ppm. But phosphates in a saltwater aquarium
                    can be a big-time trouble-maker, even at natural levels.</dd>
                <dt>Nitrate</dt>
                <dd>The fourth most important water parameter for you to monitor in
                    your reef tank is nitrate. Technically speaking, the presence of
                    low levels of nitrates in your tank could be considered a good
                    thing. It means your biological filter is working. (News flash:
                    you want that!)</dd>
                <dt>Nitrite</dt>
                <dd>you want your nitrites to remain as close to ZERO as possible. If
                    you see any level other than zero while you’re testing your
                    water, it’s a symptom that A) your biological filter has crashed
                    or B) it can’t keep up with SOME large source of ammonia (say, a
                    dead fish you haven’t located yet).</dd>
